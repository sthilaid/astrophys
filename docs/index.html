<h1>Kepler's first law</h1>
<p>
  Kerpler's first law states that the motion of a planet is an ellipse with the sun as one of it's foci:
  $$r = {p \over 1 + \epsilon \cos(\theta)}$$
  Newton's universal gravitation law is:
  $$F = {{GM_1M_2} \over {r^2}}$$
  It can be then derived that:
  $$r = {}$$
</p>
<p>
  Here is a simulation with fictional objects forming a binary system. First, the eccentricity of the ellipse interpolates from almost 0 to 0.8 (arbitrary), then the mass of \(M_1\) will start increasing with time and we can see the effect on the motion of the system.
